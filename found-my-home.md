[Verse 1]
A                       C#m
It's been a while since we first met
E                         A
Our lives entwined in ways we won't forget
A                      C#m
From Porto's sunset skies to midnight's embrace
E               A
Each moment with you, my heart found its place
A                   C#m
We used to say we'd never change
E                       A
Now we're growing, turning each page
A                   C#m
I knew I found my home with you
       E                        A
With every step, our love just grew

[Chorus]
A     C#m
Oh, I have this feeling
E                   A
I don't feel alone
A     C#m
Oh, I love this feeling
E                   A
With you, I've found my home

[Verse 2]
A                    C#m
From Portugal's charm to Poland's grace
E                       A
We've shared dreams in every place
A                        C#m
Laughing, loving, through distance and time
E                          A
Your hand in mine feels so right
A                      C#m
We wandered streets as city lights gleamed
E                      A
Living out the dreams we dreamed
A                     C#m
Our love story written across the skies
E                    A
In every look, I see my life

[Chorus]
A     C#m
Oh, I have this feeling
E                   A
I don't feel alone
A     C#m
Oh, I love this feeling
E                   A
With you, I've found my home

[Bridge]
            A                         B
And now I'm running to you, with all my heart
    F#
Knowing we've been home from the start
             A                         B
Through time's embrace, our love will stay
F#
'Cause with you, I've found my way

[Chorus]
A     C#m
Oh, I have this feeling
E                   A
I don't feel alone
A     C#m
Oh, I love this feeling
E                   A
With you, I've found my home
A     C#m
Oh, I have this feeling
E                   A
I don't feel alone
A     C#m
Oh, I love this feeling
E                   A
With you, I've found my home
          A
Found my home
